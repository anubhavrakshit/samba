Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first preview release of Samba 4.13.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.13 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

Python 3.6 Required
-------------------

Samba's minimum runtime requirement for python was raised to Python
3.5 with samba 4.12.  Samba 4.13 raises this minimum version to Python
3.6 both to access new features and because this is the oldest version
we test with in our CI infrastructure.

(Build time support for the file server with Python 2.6 has not
changed)

wide links functionality
------------------------

For this release, the code implementing the insecure "wide links = yes"
functionality has been moved out of the core smbd code and into a separate
VFS module, vfs_widelinks. Currently this vfs module is implicitly loaded
by smbd as the last but one module before vfs_default if "wide links = yes"
is enabled on the share (note, the existing restrictions on enabling wide
links around the SMB1 "unix extensions" and the "allow insecure wide links"
parameters are still in force). The implicit loading was done to allow
existing users of "wide links = yes" to keep this functionality without
having to make a change to existing working smb.conf files.

Please note that the Samba developers recommend changing any Samba
installations that currently use "wide links = yes" to use bind mounts
as soon as possible, as "wide links = yes" is an inherently insecure
configuration which we would like to remove from Samba. Moving the
feature into a VFS module allows this to be done in a cleaner way
in future.

A future release to be determined will remove this implicit linkage,
causing administrators who need this functionality to have to explicitly
add the vfs_widelinks module into the "vfs objects =" parameter lists.
The release notes will be updated to note this change when it occurs.
